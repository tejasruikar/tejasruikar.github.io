# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Tejas Ruikar**, a Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, distributed systems and ML-driven applications.

I love bridging the gap between backend performance optimization and user-centric front-end design. Whether it's architecting cloud-native solutions, building automation platforms, or optimizing API performance—I enjoy solving complex problems that make a real impact.
